  The following are pictures taken with my Canon 6D at the Udvar-Hazy Center,
  Air and Space Museum in Dulles, VA. I only used my Canon EF24-105mm lens to
  capture these images. I made most of the pictures black and white for a more
  dramatic effect. The first picture is the iconic SR-71 Blackbird, the second
  picture is the Space Shuttle Discovery, and the third is the Boeing B-29
  Superfortress Enola Gay, better known for dropping the first atomic weapons in
  Hiroshima, Japan.
