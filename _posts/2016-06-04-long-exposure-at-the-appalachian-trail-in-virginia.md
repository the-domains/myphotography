I took these pictures on Christmas day using my Canon 6D along with my EF24-105mm lens. I used various focal lengths between 24mm and 40mm for the shots. I decided to use long exposure between 25 and 60 second exposure at f/4.0, ISO 100\. I must caveat that I used a ND 1000, 10 stop filter to get these shots. I had to experiment with the aperture as I was shooting in foggy condition.
